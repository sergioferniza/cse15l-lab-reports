- In this case we see that the test of the link 
- caused, an infinite loop error. Because of it we
- changed the code to break the loop once we have the answer.

2nd code change:

- Same as in the last, there is an infinite loop. 
- As such we have to add a condition to stop the
- loop once we obtain the value we are looking for

3rd code change:

- Again there is an infinity loop. Because of it 
- we changed the code to break the code once
- the loop gives us the answer we are looking for.
